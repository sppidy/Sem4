                    India Breaks Silence On The H-1B Visa Debate. Here's What You Need To Know
                    India emphasised the importance of skilled professionals' movement between India and the US

                    India has emphasised the importance of skilled professionals' movement between India and the US,
                    stating
                    that it benefits both nations. This comes amid a heated debate over H-1B visas, with President-elect
                    Donald Trump and Elon Musk recently weighing in.

                    In a recent post, Mr. Musk defended the H-1B visa programme on social media, "The reason I'm in
                    America
                    along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made
                    America strong is because of H1B."

                    "I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend", he added.

                    The debate has exposed deep divisions among Mr. Trump's allies, with some supporting the H-1B visa
                    programme as essential for the tech industry, while others see it as a threat to American jobs. Mr.
                    Trump himself has expressed support for the programme, despite previously signing an executive order
                    to
                    restrict access to such visas.

                    India's foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, highlighted the strong economic and
                    technological partnership between the two countries, noting that the mobility of skilled
                    professionals
                    is a crucial component. He emphasised that India-US economic ties benefit greatly from the technical
                    expertise provided by these professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and
                    competitive
                    value.

                    "Our countries have a strong and growing economic and technological partnership and within this
                    ambit,
                    mobility of skilled professionals is an important component," Mr. Jaiswal, told a press conference
                    when
                    asked about the H-1B visa discussions in the U.S.

                    "India-U.S economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled
                    professionals,
                    with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value. We look forward to further
                    deepening
                    India-U.S economic ties which are to our mutual benefit‚Äù, he added.

                    The numbers speak for themselves: India received approximately 78% of the 265,777 H1B visas issued
                    by
                    the US in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. This underscores the significant role Indian
                    professionals play in the US tech industry.

                    Mr. Trump has expressed full support for the H1B program, despite opposition from some of his
                    supporters. Mr. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has also vowed to defend the program,
                    stating he's willing to go to "war" for it.

                    As the US and India look to strengthen their ties under Mr. Trump, India's foreign minister Dr S
                    Jaishankar has already met with Mr. Trump's transition team. The country is eager to deepen its
                    economic
                    ties with the US, recognising the mutual benefits that arise from their partnership.

                    This development is part of a broader trend of growing US-India cooperation, with bilateral trade
                    increasing by 7.65% to USD 129 billion in 2022-23.

                    Ultimately, the movement of skilled professionals between India and the US is a critical aspect of
                    their
                    economic and technological partnership. As both nations continue to navigate the complexities of
                    this
                    relationship, it's clear that mutual benefits and cooperation will remain a top priority.
